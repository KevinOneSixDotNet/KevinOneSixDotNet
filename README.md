Hello, my name is Kevin and I am a full-stack C#/Typescript web developer from Buffalo, NY.

My GitHub repositories contains projects that I have worked on in my spare time and nothing that is proprietary to any company that I work for.

1.) Hashtag-Search: This is a project that I did as a part of my interview process for Utilant back in 2017.

2.) TicTacToe: This is a fork of my friend's repository for a windows console app they built to famialiarize themselves with C#. 
-I made the fork to demonstrate via a PR some of things I would do to architect his initial version using conventions more 
<br/>
-familiar to Object Oriented Programming. I also wanted to demonstrate some of my approaches to refactoring.

3.) Swerdle: This a clone of the popular daily online game Wordle. It is done using React + Typescript and backed with a simple asp net core API. 
-It is currently hosted as a docker containt on a Google Cloud App Engine instance: https://swerdle.ue.r.appspot.com/
-It does not use redux and use's React State hooks + browser local storage to persist state across browser sessions.
      
4.) Interview Problems: This is combination of various smaller projects that I have encountered in interviews over the year. 
-Linked List demonstrates a C# implementation of a Linked List without using the .NET framework collections that are provided. It has basic unit tests to demonstrate its correctness, as well as the scope of what it supports.
-CSV Parser demonstrates a set of functions that can deserialize a CSV file to collection of classes defined by the user. 
<br/>
        I made this because I actually failed a technical interview as a junior developer with not being familiar enough with how 
<br/>
        to do something like this since XML/JSON serializers were so ubiquitous in the actual work experience I had up until that point.
